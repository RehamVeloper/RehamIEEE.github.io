                        A main part of human nature is to persevere in times of hardship. Through innovation and
                        ingenuity, humans have overcome all kinds of crises. Corona-virus has become one of the most
                        severe challenges of our generation. As a result, IEEE Zewail City is hosting the Crisis
                        Engineering Contest to connect civil society, mentors, developers, analytic engineers,
                        innovators, and other related fields to develop new, innovative and engineering-oriented
                        solutions for problems and challenges related directly or indirectly to COVID-19 pandemic by
                        setting an example and basis for future innovators on how to handle this and all future crises.
                        Itâ€™s not only by providing solutions for ongoing problems in our time but also to preemptively
                        predict and tackle future hardships. For example, our fellow students and faculty members in
                        Zewail City gathered and made three prototypes for locally assembled affordable ventilators for
                        use in cases of breathing difficulties.

                            In the time of global uncertainty, one of the most crucial categories of challenges is the
                            industrial and financial category. The societies we live in are integral of a codependent
                            nature, as in businesses depending on other businesses to outsource or sell goods, leaving
                            us with grave danger for the livelihoods of many

                            While the corona-virus pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, it is causing a considerable
                            degree of fear, worry, and concern in the general population and among certain groups in
                            particular, such as the elderly, care providers, and people with health problems. In
                            general, health systems experience varying levels of stress in the face of increasing
                            infection rates.
